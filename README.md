# 42 Porto Projects

## Introduction
Repository with the projects that I have developed and am currently developing at 42 Porto.
The repository is divided into the projects developed during Piscine #7 (./Piscine) and the projects that I am currently working on from the Common Core (./Common_Core).

## Piscine
The Piscine is a 26 day bootcamp that you have to go through to enroll in the 42 Porto curriculum. We started with some projects in Shell and ended gaining basic skills in C. The Piscine will not only give you invaluable skills for your journey at 42, but also help you create friendships and understand if you like the learning style at the school.

## Common Core
Common Core is the beginning of the 42 curriculum that everyone has to go through before starting a specialization. The projects during this part of the curriculum are mostly done in C and C++, and will give you an extremely strong fundation in programming.
